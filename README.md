This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing heart attack-related data and building a model to predict the likelihood of a heart attack based on clinical features.

---

## 📌 Overview

The `heart_attack.ipynb` notebook walks through the full pipeline of:

- Data loading and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations of key health indicators
- Feature correlation and selection
- Model training and evaluation (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees)

The goal is to understand patterns in heart attack-related risk factors and to create a predictive model based on the dataset.
